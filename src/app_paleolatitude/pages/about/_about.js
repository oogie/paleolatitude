                            The paleolatitude calculator has been updated to cover the entire Phanerozoic (550-0 Ma),
                            where possible. The changes compared to the original calculator as described in Van Hinsbergen
                            et al. (2015) are the following.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Paleolatitudes and error bars are now available for the full age range covered by
                                    the APWP of Kent and Irving (2010), i.e., 230-50 Ma;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Paleolatitudes and error bars are now available for the full age range covered
                                    by the GAPWaP of Torsvik et al. (2012), i.e., 320-0 Ma.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Paleolatitudes and error bars of the China blocks have been extended beyond 130
                                    Ma using the China APWP of Van der Voo et al. (2015). North China paleolatitudes
                                    are available since 230 Ma, and South China paleolatitudes since 170 Ma, as explained
                                    by those authors.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    For times prior to 320 Ma, we have included the spline-fitted APWPâ€™s of Torsvik
                                    et al. (2012) for Gondwana (Africa, India, Madagascar, Australia, Antarctica, South
                                    America), Laurentia (North America and Greenland), Baltica, and Siberia.
                                    The spline fitting methodology used by Torsvik et al. does not allow to quantify
                                    uncertainties, and pre-320 Ma paleolatitudes are therefore included without error bars.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Because some of the major post-200 Ma continents consist of fragments that were on
                                    separate plates prior to 320 Ma, the plate model has been slightly modified. The Eurasian
                                    plate (originally coded 301) is now separated into Baltica (301), Siberia (401), and the
                                    Eurasian Variscides (315) that does not extend back farther than 320 Ma. We added the Alleghanian
                                    orogen of North America (199), which prior to 320 Ma was not part stable Laurentia.
                                    The original polygon 601 for the amalgamated China blocks is now broken down into North
                                    China (601), South China (602) and Amuria (453).
